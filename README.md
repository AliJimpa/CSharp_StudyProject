# C# Learning
A personal repository documenting my journey from **basic to advanced C# & dotnet**, including data structures, algorithms, system-level concepts.
This repo is both a **learning hub** and a **playground** where I experiment, implement, and explore C# deeply.
## 🧭 Overview
This project contains:
- Fundamental C# concepts  
- Intermediate & advanced C# features  
- Hands-on exercises  
- Mini-projects  
- Notes, references, and best practices

## 📁 Dotnet Basic
Any project in this repo is based on this approach to create & Build
```bash
dotnet --version 
dotnet new console -n MyConsoleApp  // Creates a console application & Names the project MyConsoleApp
cd MyConsoleApp
